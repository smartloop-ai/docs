Smartloop AI is an open-source and no-code Small Language Model (SLM) platform designed to create domain-specific language models from custom sources. It aims to save costs, reduce energy consumption, and minimize hallucination in AI models.

## Features
- **Effortless Model Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune models using private data for enhanced accuracy.
- **No-Code Dataset Generation**: Generate datasets and fine-tune models based on uploaded documents.
- **Energy and Cost-Efficient**: Provides the best value and performance.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Run models on devices or behind firewalls to ensure data security.
- **High-Level API and Interface**: Tailored for businesses and large organizations.

## Use Cases
- Fine-tuning models for domain-specific applications.
- Processing, chunking, and vectorizing documents for accurate information extraction.
- Deploying models on private clouds or edge devices.

## FAQ
### What is fine-tuning a model?
Fine-tuning converts a model into a specialized version for a given dataset, enhancing its accuracy for specific topics or domains.

### What are baseline models vs fine-tuned models?
Baseline models like GPT-4 are general-purpose, while fine-tuned models are tailored for specialized applications.

### How do you fine-tune models?
Smartloop uses techniques like LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation) for efficient fine-tuning.

### What is a token limit?
Token limits restrict the number of tokens an LLM can process in a single interaction. For free plans, the limit is 16K tokens.
